# Urban-Threads-D2C-Fashion-Brand-Order_Returns_Analytics
* This project studies Q4 online shopping data to understand why orders increase during Diwali and why returns go up afterwards.*
* It is made to help the business reduce returns, improve customer experience, and make better decisions using data. *
* The project finds important patterns like size problems, high returns from new customers, and return spikes after discount periods.*
* It shows which categories (Tops, Dresses, Outerwear) and which customer groups (new users, app users) face the most issues.*
* It gives simple, practical solutions like better size charts, limiting COD for new users, and improving product photos & details.*
* It also suggests testing ideas (like an A/B test for size tools) and gives clear limitations and assumptions to make the analysis reliable.*
